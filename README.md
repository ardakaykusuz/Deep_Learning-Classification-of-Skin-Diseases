# Multi Classification Problem for Skin Diseases
A lot of people sadly suffer from skin diseases globally that not only cause physical discomfort but also mental stress (shame, embarrassment, etc.). That is why early and accurate classification of these conditions might be consequential for a more effective treatment. Traditionally, the diagnoses were made by visual examination from the doctor, sometimes complimented by biopsies and other tests. But this approach is subjective and can be unreliable, especially for complex and less common conditions. The goal of this project is to address the limitations of traditional diagnosis methods by using deep learning tools and techniques that have already proved their worth in image analysis tasks, including medical image classification. By putting deep learning to use, we are going to develop a model that can classify skin diseases, to aid dermatologists in their diagnoses and ultimately improve patient care and satisfaction.
